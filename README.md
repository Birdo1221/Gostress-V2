# Gostress-V2 C2 Framework

GostressV2: Just a simpler more chill, non-Tor version

> This does support Proxys like Original the [Gostress-Enhanced ](https://github.com/Birdo1221/Gostress-Enhanced)

## üìå Overview

A robust command and control framework designed for authorized penetration testing and security research.

- **Encrypted TLS Communication** with client agents
- **Direct Secure Connection** with end-to-end encryption
- **Multi-user Role-Based Access Control**
- **Real-time Dashboard** with performance metrics
- **Multiple Network Testing Vectors** with adaptive rate limiting
- **Client Health Monitoring** with heartbeat system

The supplied User is `root:jDT38z7X82Ox`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This framework is intended solely for authorized security testing, educational purposes, and legitimate security research. Always obtain proper authorization before testing any system. Unauthorized use may violate laws and regulations.

## üî• Features

### Core Architecture

- **Asynchronous Design**: Non-blocking I/O for 10,000+ concurrent clients
- **Modular Testing System**: Pluggable test modules with runtime validation
- **Ephemeral Clients**: Auto-cleanup of stale connections
- **HMAC Challenge-Response**: For client authentication

    Client->>Server: HMAC-SHA256(nonce)
    Server->>Client: AUTH_SUCCESS
    loop Heartbeat
        Client->>Server: PONG (30s interval)
    end
```

### Network Testing Capabilities

| Method | Layer | Description | Max Duration |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| UDP Test | 4 | High-volume UDP packet testing | 3600s |
| TCP Smart | 4 | Stateful TCP session analysis | 1800s |
| GRE Test | 3 | Protocol examination with GRE packets | 600s |
| HTTP Connection Test | 7 | Partial HTTP requests with keepalive | 300s |

### Security Features

- **Argon2id Password Hashing**: 128MB memory / 4 threads
- **JWT Authentication**: 15-minute expiry with refresh
- **CSRF Protection**: Per-session tokens
- **CSP Headers**: Strict Content Security Policy
- **IP Binding**: Optional client IP verification
- **Forward Secrecy**: TLS 1.3 with PFS cipher suites

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt install golang-go postgresql
```

### Setup

Generate certificates:
```bash
go run main.go -gencert
```

Configure the server:
```bash
# Edit config.json to set binding address, ports and security settings
nano config.json
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Features

```mermaid
pie
    title Dashboard Components
    "Client Network" : 35
    "Test Control" : 30
    "User Management" : 20
    "Analytics" : 15
```

### Real-time Monitoring

- Client geographic distribution
- CPU/RAM utilization heatmap
- Network throughput graphs
- Packet loss metrics

### User Roles

| Role | Concurrent Tests | Methods Available | Duration Limit |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Owner | 5 | All | 60 min |
| Admin | 5 | No UPDATE command | 30 min |
| Pro | 3 | Basic protocols | 10 min |
| Basic | 1 | UDP/TCP only | 5 min |

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Start the server:
```bash
go build -o secure-c2 && ./secure-c2
```

Access via HTTPS:
```bash
curl -k https://localhost:443
```

Default credentials:
```
Username: root
Password: [generated during first run]
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

```mermaid

    title Test Lifecycle
    dateFormat  HH:mm:ss
    section Client Network
    Connection Establishment :a1, 00:00:00, 5s
    Challenge Response      :a2, after a1, 3s
    section Test
    Command Propagation     :a3, 00:00:08, 2s
    Traffic Generation      :a4, after a3, 30s
```

- Throughput: 1.2M packets/sec per client
- Latency: <100ms command propagation (direct connection)
- Scalability: Tested with 5,000 concurrent clients

## üîê Enhanced Security Options

### Network Security Configuration

- **IP Allowlisting**: Restrict client connections by IP range
- **Connection Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attempts
- **TLS Certificate Pinning**: For verified client connections
- **Optional VPN Integration**: For additional security layer

### Defensive Measures
